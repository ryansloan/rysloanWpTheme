#To set up this theme:#
##Pages Setup##
1. Create a new page for the front landing Page. The content of that page is what will be displayed in the blurb beside the picture.
2. Create a new page for the blog post page.

##Menus Setup##
There are three menus:
* Front Page Menu - These links appear below the blurb on the front landing page.

2) Click "Create New Menu"
3) Select the appropriate Menu location (Front Page, Header, or Follow Me On)
4) Add the appropriate pages or links to the menu.
5) Save.
